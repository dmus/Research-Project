- Acceleration-Model
Implementation of the Acceleration-One-Step dynamics model and the Acceleration-Lagged dynamics model.
Contains also code to test performance.

- Direct-Model
Uses linear regression to predict next state given current state and action. Fitted value iteration
is used to measure performance.

- Trials
Contains expert and apprentice trials on different racetracks with different controllers.

- Yaw-Rate-Estimation
Different approaches for estimating the yaw rate of the car.
